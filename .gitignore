#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the actual version really matters.
#   For applications, however, it's a good idea to ignore them.

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no binary wheel available, pipenv lock file may cause problems. Possible solution is
#   to make separate environments for different platforms. Refer to issue #1784 for some discussion.
